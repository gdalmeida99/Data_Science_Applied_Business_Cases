# Business Case 5


In this project the main goal was to process a large data file of weekly sales of an Australian Appliance Chain, in order to:
1.	Create an appropriated segmentation of the Points of Sale, by Value and Preferences, where it was used Time Series Clustering Techniques (K-Means with Dynamic Time Wrapping), being it combined in the Preference perspective with K-Modes algorithm, for reasons explained in the report. 
2.	Forecast next 6 weeks of sales at the product level by Point of Sale (having originally 410 Points of Sale and more than 2500 different products), where several techniques were attempted, achieving the best results with a combination of Time Series Clustering (in this case the K-Shape, due to the intended use) and SARMIX models. This final model provides an innovative approach, that is efficient to run, and that has shown robust results, being able to reduce thousands of different Time Series to a few  centroid shapes that then needed to be properly modelled.  


This project was developed in Python and here you can find the Jupyter Notebook with all the steps followed ( according to the CRISP-DM methodology) and the report delivered with it.
