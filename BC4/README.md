# Business Case 4

In this project the main goal was to create a recommendation system for an online store.
More information can be found here: https://github.com/gdalmeida99/business-cases/tree/master/BC4_recommendation_system. 
This project was fully developed in Python and here you can find the Jupyter Notebook with all the steps followed ( according to the CRISP-DM methodology) and the report delivered with it.
Furthermore, it was also developed a dashboard (with the link of deployment in the corresponding pdf) with the static recommendations made at this point in time, and a script to automatize the update process described at the end of the Report, this is, with the deployment system almost fully in place.
